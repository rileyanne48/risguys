    <h1>Hi! Welcome to Ri's Guys. <br>
    <h2>This lil company is centered around all things art! Here lies a curated collection of items made by myself, Riley Huebner, as I move through my many phases of artistic styles.</h2>
    <p>Growing up, I was surrounded by a plethora of crafts and along with my older sister, took on many different artistic hobbies. We painted, drew, mosaiced, woodburned, sewed, sculpted, made stamps, and even went through a gourd decorating phase. The creative childhood I was given made me realize that I never have to truly decide what kind of artist I am going to be, and that is a beautiful thing.
